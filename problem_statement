In an era where nutritional awareness is paramount, there is a lack of accessible tools that can efficiently identify fruits and vegetables and provide accurate nutritional information.
This project addresses this gap by developing a web application that uses machine learning and computer vision to classify images of fruits and vegetables and calculate
their calorie content,
offering users an easy and accurate way to track their nutritional intake.
