                                 ### ABSTRACT
This project introduces a lightweight deep learning model for fruit and vegetable recognition,
combining a modified MobileNetV2 architecture with an attention module. The model begins by
extracting convolutional features to capture essential object-based information, followed by an
attention mechanism that enhances semantic understanding. By integrating these modules, the
model effectively balances high-level object representation with nuanced semantic details crucial
for accurate classification.
Utilizing transfer learning from a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model optimizes training efficiency
and adaptation to specific fruit datasets. Evaluation across three benchmark datasets demonstrates
that the proposed model surpasses four recent deep learning methods in classification accuracy
while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. This makes it well-suited for
applications in industries related to fruit cultivation, retail, and processing, where automatic fruit
identification are valuable for operational efficiency and quality control.
